# GameRoomSDD
Software Design Document used to compare Operating Systems for updating software application from Android to Microsoft, respectively.

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

For Modules One through Six in CS230 - Operating Platforms, our class developed code and integrated an API for a Maven project with Eclipse. This document is necessary for the product owner to define the scope and plan phases of the project. Included is the software design document that verifies information needed to update the game to another operating system, value created by the development team, and comparative resources to validate expenses, timelines, and computaional aspects for this approach.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I enjoyed updating the UML Diagram and gained skills in the process. I have a better understanding of class relationships and attributes correlated within the documentaion review for planning software classes.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Refrencing information that is vital to the creation process undoubtedly returns beneficial factors so that the design process is well thought out and is completed iteratively by a continuum of comprehensive instructions.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would definately go back and examine the recommendations for various systems architectures and identify improved variations to compliment software development cycles.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs were defined in a powerpoint presentation that suggested improvements and requirements for the android game, Win It or Lose It to be maintained on an additional operating system for Microsoft to be found in the Apple Store. Memory management, smooth processing, quick response times, and single-instance representaions during unlimited game instances with a singleton class were suggested for the game updates. I was able to gather this information and creatively design solutions for game development and factor the importance of the Product Owner's requirement documentation so that acceptance among early stages would be approved to continue game dev. It is important to remember the values of what is asked and follow instructions so that the stakeholders are satisfied and build a relationship and reputation for competence and professional manners.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I accepted the task and planned phases early in the project to factor the timeline during game development. I use skills based knowledge first to assess the scope and utilize software design documentaion to complete necessary requirements on time and return dynamic deliverables. In the future I may take courses to update my knowledge for new coding practices and infer with stakeholders to confirm design requirements.
